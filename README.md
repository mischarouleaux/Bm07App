# Bm07App
Minor Cross App Development Web API

Thanks to this course, I came into contact with web api, xamarin, xamarin forms etc. Even though this was a school project, it was a project with a real client: a group of healthcare providers. The main purpose was to ensure that a group could work together through a mobile application.

The project was done with a group of 15 students, I myself assumed the role of project leader.

I have mainly worked on the web api and managing the project.

The project was awesome, especially because of the size of the group. Give another challenge instead of just creating an app!
